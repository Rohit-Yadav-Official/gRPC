### How gRPC Works

In gRPC, a client application can directly call a method on a server application on a different machine as if it were a local object, making it easy to build distributed applications and services.

As with many RPC systems, gRPC is based on the idea of defining a service that specifies methods that can be called remotely with their parameters and return types. On the server side, the server implements this interface and runs a gRPC server to handle client calls. On the client side, the client has a stub that provides the same methods as the server.

gRPC clients and servers can work and talk to each other in different environments, from servers to your own desktop applications, and can be written in any language that gRPC supports. For example, you can easily create a gRPC server in Java or C# with clients in Go, Python, or Ruby.

### Working with Protocol Buffers

gRPC uses Protocol Buffers by default. Protocol Buffers are Google’s open-source mechanism for serializing structured data.

When working with protocol buffers, the first step is to define the structure of the data you want to serialize in a .proto file: this is an ordinary text file with the extension .proto. The protocol buffer data is structured as messages where each message is a small logical information record containing a series of name-value pairs called fields.

Once you’ve determined your data structures, you use the protocol buffer compiler (protoc) to create data access classes in the languages of your choice from your protocol definition.

You can find the complete language guide in Google’s official documentation for the Protocol Buffer language [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview).

### gRPC Method Types — RPC Lifecycles

gRPC lets you define four kinds of service methods:

- **Unary RPCs**: The client sends a single request to the server and gets a single response back, similar to a normal function call.
- **Server streaming RPCs**: The client sends a request to the server and gets a stream to read a sequence of messages back. Message ordering is guaranteed within an RPC call.
- **Client streaming RPCs**: The client writes a sequence of messages and sends them to the server, which reads them and returns a response after processing.
- **Bidirectional streaming RPCs**: Both client and server send a sequence of messages using a read-write stream. Messages can be sent and received in any order.

### Advantages of gRPC

General advantages of gRPC include:

- Using HTTP/2, which provides 30–40% more performance compared to HTTP/1.1, and supports bidirectional streaming.
- Higher performance and less bandwidth usage than JSON with binary serialization.
- Support for multiple languages and platforms.
- Open-source with a strong community support.
- Support for SSL/TLS usage and various authentication methods.

### gRPC vs REST

gRPC has advantages over REST-based APIs, particularly in terms of efficiency due to smaller message sizes with Protocol Buffers and streamlined RPC lifecycle management.

Unlike REST, which uses textual JSON data and operates on HTTP/1.1, gRPC works on contract-based, binary protocol communication similar to SOAP.

### gRPC Usage in Microservices Communication

gRPC is primarily used for backend microservice-to-microservice communication where immediate responses are necessary for continued processing.

Additionally, gRPC is used in:

- Polyglot environments requiring support for mixed programming platforms.
- Low latency and high throughput communication scenarios.
- Point-to-point real-time communication without polling, ideal for bi-directional streaming.
- Network-constrained environments where binary gRPC messages are smaller than equivalent JSON messages.

### Example of gRPC in Microservices Communication

Consider an example where a Web-Marketing API Gateway forwards requests to a Shopping Aggregator Microservice. The Shopping Aggregator Microservice receives a request from a client, dispatches it to various microservices, aggregates the results, and sends them back to the client. Such operations typically require synchronous communication for immediate responses.

In this scenario, backend calls from the Aggregator are performed using gRPC. The Shopping Aggregator implements a gRPC client, which makes synchronous gRPC calls to backend microservices that implement gRPC servers. Both client and server components are configured for HTTP/2 protocol required for gRPC communication.

While most microservices communications in event-driven architectures are asynchronous, direct synchronous calls using gRPC are ideal for high-performance scenarios requiring immediate responses.

### Drawbacks of Direct Client-to-Microservices Communication

Direct client-to-microservices communication, while efficient in certain scenarios, can present challenges in large and complex microservices architectures. Each microservice exposing public endpoints can lead to increased complexity in managing client requests, potential chatty communication patterns, and increased latency due to multiple network calls.

Managing security and cross-cutting concerns such as authorization across multiple microservices can also become cumbersome when implemented at the microservice level. Additionally, integrating long-running APIs that require asynchronous processing into client applications becomes complex without a centralized event-driven model using message
